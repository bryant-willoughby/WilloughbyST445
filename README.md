# WilloughbyST445

I completed a final project for ST 445 (Statistical Computing & Data Management). I was assigned project instructions with the two major goals of (a) data handling and (b) result generation. Below, I describe the respective files (and folder) to accomplish these tasks: 

1. Final Project.pdf
- You can access the case study and other resources for the textbook with the following link: https://jonathanduggins.com/books
- The Business Case Study link (https://people.uncw.edu/blumj/businesscasestudy.html) provides an overview of the project context, links to the data sets, and includes some descriptions of the output objects and the output objects themselves. 
2. Willoughby_Final_Exam_1.sas
- Data Handling
3. Willoughby_Final_Exam_2.sas

4. Results (folder)
